# Project
Build something awesome

## For this project you will accomplish the following
 - Build an application of your choosing with yourself and 2-4 other team members
 - Learn how to collaborate to build a single application
 - Show off your skills
 
## The project is split into two parts
  - Part I: Defining your project and building your teams
  - Part II: Implementing your project idea, presenting to the class, and writing about it

## Your team of 3-5 people (non-negotiable, no single/dual projects) must complete the following:
 - Think of a web application that you would like to build
 - Build the web application that you came up with
 - Send/Save some data to an external service, e.g. Google Firebase
 - Demo the web application and present it to the rest of the class **without any slides**
 - Submit a write-up that consists of a description of the web application that was built
 

## Part I

### Split into teams of 3-5 and submit a project idea
 - There are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule. Each team must have at least 3 people. If need be I will form teams.
 - Each team needs to come up with the web application that they would like to build. Here are some examples:
  - A Todo application
  - The game of chess
 - We will take a look at initial drafts of the web application that you have chosen to build and comment on the feasibility of your project idea and return with comments
 
## Part II
 
### Build your application
 - Each team will have one repository where they will push their changes
 - This could be the first time you were not the only users in your own repository. Beware of merge conflicts and editing the same file with someone else
 - git pull often
 
### Prepare and deliver for your presentation
 - Prep for a 10 minute presentation, and 5 minutes for questions
 - Please note: presentations in this class are demo's of the actual web application, not slides
 - **There will be a 15 point deduction of the project grade if slides are used in the presentation**
 
### Commit all changes in repo and write a paper on what you did and name it LEARNINGS.md
 - LEARNINGS.md should contain the following:
  - A description of what your project does and the functionality that it provides
  - A list of at least ten different web technologies that you used in your web application and where they are used
